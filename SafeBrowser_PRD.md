# SafeBrowser: Product Requirements Document
*Version 2.0 - Updated with Onboarding Tour System*

## Executive Summary

SafeBrowser is a premium web browser specifically designed for adults aged 65+ who want to enjoy the internet safely and confidently. Unlike traditional browsers that overwhelm users with complex features, SafeBrowser prioritizes security, simplicity, and peace of mind through intelligent protection systems, accessibility-first design, an integrated AI assistant, and a comprehensive onboarding tour that ensures users feel confident from their very first session.

## Problem Statement

Older adults face unique challenges online that existing browsers don't adequately address:

- **Security vulnerabilities**: Higher susceptibility to scams, phishing, and malware due to less familiarity with threat indicators
- **Complexity barriers**: Modern browsers are feature-heavy and intimidating, with confusing settings and interfaces
- **Accessibility gaps**: Poor text sizing, low contrast, and complex navigation patterns
- **Trust deficit**: Uncertainty about which websites and information sources are legitimate
- **Learning curve**: No guided introduction to safety features, leaving users to discover protection tools on their own
- **Support needs**: Difficulty getting help when something goes wrong or seems suspicious

Current solutions either treat seniors as an afterthought or oversimplify to the point of limiting functionality. SafeBrowser bridges this gap with intelligent protection that doesn't condescend, combined with an onboarding system that builds confidence from day one.
